- Delivery bands ingestion now treats zero fees as valid values and defaults PlatformFeePct to 0.12 when blank; skip logs enumerate missing fields.
- Stabilized inspect_xlsx alias maps (delivery/offers) and added a size-mix loader CLI that normalizes shares when source sheets are available.
- Pre-commit guard now resolves repo roots via git before delegating to protected_paths_guard.py.
- Previously only 1 delivery row was accepted (5 skipped); loader now accepts rows even when fee columns are 0 (skips only truly missing rows).
- Added scripts/dev_sanity.sh with step-by-step checks (fill DELIVERY_XLSX and OFFERS_XLSX paths, then run). OK to run after user fills paths.
